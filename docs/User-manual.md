## Getting started with Git-Mediawiki

You need to have git installed on your machine, see the [help with setup for windows] (http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/), [mac](http://help.github.com/mac-set-up-git/) or [linux](http://help.github.com/linux-set-up-git/).

Then, the first operation you should do is cloning the remote mediawiki. To do so, run the command

`git clone mediawiki::http://yourwikiadress.com`

From now on, you can use your traditional pull, push, add, commit... and your favorite IDE to work on your wiki pages
