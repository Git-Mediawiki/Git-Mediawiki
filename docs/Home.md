Welcome to the wiki of the Git-Mediawiki's project .

## What is Git-Mediawiki ?

Git-Mediawiki is a project which aim is to create a gate between git and mediawiki, allowing git users to push and pull objects from mediawiki just as one would do with a classic git repository.

**For more information, read the [[User manual]].**

## Are there already other solutions ?

Github and ikiwiki propose solutions for git-based wikis. Our project wants to be transparent to wiki users and transplantable on any wiki without having to change anything server-side. A simple git clone on a mediawiki would initialize a repository on your side and you would be able to interact with the wiki without bothering classic users.

## Who are we ?

Git-Mediawiki was essentially developed by [Ensimag](http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/) students (see the logs for the detailed list of authors), supervised  by [Matthieu Moy](https://matthieu-moy.fr/), with the help of the [git community](http://git.kernel.org/).

Do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions about the project.
