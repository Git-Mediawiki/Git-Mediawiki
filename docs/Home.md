Welcome to the wiki of the Git-Mediawiki's project .

## What is Git-Mediawiki ?

Git-Mediawiki is a project which aim is to create a gate between git and mediawiki, allowing git users to push and pull objects from mediawiki just as one would do with a classic git repository.

**For more information, read the [[User manual]].**

## Are there already other solutions ?

Github and ikiwiki propose solutions for git-based wikis. Our project wants to be transparent to wiki users and transplantable on any wiki without having to change anything server-side. A simple git clone on a mediawiki would initialize a repository on your side and you would be able to interact with the wiki without bothering classic users.

## Who are we ?

We are four students : [Jérémie Nikaes](mailto:nikaesj@ensimag.fr), [Claire Fousse](mailto:foussec@ensimag.fr), [Arnaud Lacurie](mailto:lacuriea@ensimag.fr) and [David Amouyal](mailto:amouyald@ensimag.fr) from [Ensimag](http://www.ensimag.fr), an IT engineering school based in Grenoble - France. This is part of our end-year project for our second year of studies in this school. This project is mentored by [Matthieu Moy](http://www-verimag.imag.fr/~moy/?lang=en) and [Sylvain Boulme](http://www-verimag.imag.fr/~boulme/), and developed with the help of the [git community](http://git.kernel.org/).

Do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions about the project.
